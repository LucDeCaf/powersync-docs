title: "Healthchecks"

<Info>
  This requires the Docker image to be `journeyapps/powersync-service:0.5.8` or later.
</Info>

The following endpoints can be used to check the health of your PowerSync Service instance. This provides a way to catch issues before they impact your users.

### Startup:

You can use the `/probes/startup` endpoint to confirm the service has started up correctly.

A `200` status code shows the service has started up.

A `400` status code shows the service has **not** yet started.

### Liveness:

You can use the `/probes/liveness` endpoint to confirm the service is alive.

A `200` status code shows the service is alive.

A `400` status code shows the service is **not** alive.

<Tip>
  **Example**: An example configuration with Docker Compose is available in the [self-host-demo app](https://github.com/powersync-ja/self-host-demo/blob/main/services/powersync.yaml).
