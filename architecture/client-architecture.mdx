description: "On the client, the application [defines a schema](/usage/installation/client-side-setup/define-your-schema) with tables, columns and indexes."

These are then usable as if they were actual SQLite tables, while in reality these are created as SQLite views.

The client SDK maintains the following tables:

1. `ps_data__<table>` This contains the data for `<table>` , in JSON format. This table's schema does not change when columns are added, removed or changed.
2. `ps_data_local__<table>` Same as the above, but for local-only tables.
3. `<table>` (VIEW) - this is a view on the above table, with each defined column extracted from the JSON field. For example, a "description" text column would be `CAST(data ->> '$.description' as TEXT)`.
4. `ps_untyped` \- Any synced table that does is not defined in the client-side schema is placed here. If the table is added to the schema at a later point, the data is then migrated to `ps_data__<table>`.
5. `ps_oplog` \- This is data as received by the [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service), grouped per bucket.
6. `ps_crud` \- The local upload queue.
7. `ps_buckets` \- A small amount of metadata for each bucket.
8. `ps_migrations` \- Table keeping track of SDK schema migrations.

Most rows will be present in at least two tables â€” the `ps_data__<table>` table, and in `ps_oplog`. It may be present multiple times in `ps_oplog`, if it was synced via multiple buckets.

The copy in `ps_oplog` may be newer than the one in `ps_data__<table>`. Only when a full checkpoint has been download, will the data be copied over to the individual tables. If multiple rows with the same table and id has been synced, only one will be preserved (the one with the highest `op_id`).
