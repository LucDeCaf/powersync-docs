title: "Authentication Setup"
description: "PowerSync clients (i.e. apps used by your users that embed the PowerSync Client SDK) authenticate against the server-side [PowerSync Service](/architecture/powersync-service) using [JWTs](https://jwt.io/) (signed tokens) that are generated by your application backend."
sidebarTitle: Overview
---

Users are not persisted in PowerSync, and there is no server-to-server communication used for client authentication.

Some authentication providers already generate JWTs for users which PowerSync can verify directly —see the documentation for individual providers (e.g. [Supabase Auth](/usage/installation/authentication-setup/supabase-auth), [Firebase Auth](/usage/installation/authentication-setup/firebase-auth))

For others, some backend code must be added to your application backend to generate the JWTs needed for PowerSync — see [Custom](/usage/installation/authentication-setup/custom) authentication.

For a quick way to get up and running during development, you can generate [Development Tokens](/usage/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens) directly from the [PowerSync Dashboard](/usage/tools/powersync-dashboard) (PowerSync Cloud) or locally with a self-hosted setup.
