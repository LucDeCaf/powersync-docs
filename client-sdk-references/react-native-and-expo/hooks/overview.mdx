The `@powersync/react` package provides React/React Native hooks for use with the [JavaScript Web SDK](/client-sdk-references/javascript-web) or the [React Native SDK](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo).

### Which package should I choose for queries?

For React or React Native apps:

* The [`@powersync/react`](#react-hooks) package is best for most basic use cases, especially when you only need reactive queries with loading and error states.

* For more advanced scenarios, such as query caching and pagination, TanStack is a powerful solution. The [`@powersync/tanstack-react-query`](#tanstack-query) package extends the `useQuery` hook from `@powersync/react` and adds functionality from [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview), making it a better fit for advanced use cases or performance-optimized apps.
