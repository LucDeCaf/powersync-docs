PowerSync is designed to be stack agnostic, and currently supports **Postgres**, **MongoDB** (alpha) and **MySQL** (alpha) as the source database, and has official SDKs for **Flutter**, **React Native**, **JS/Web**, **Kotlin Multiplatform** (beta) and **Swift** (alpha) available on the client-side today. More platforms are on our [Roadmap](https://roadmap.powersync.com/), so if one isn't supported today, please add your vote and check back soon.

If you are using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as your backend, we provide a [PowerSync\<>Supabase integration guide](/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync) which incudes a tutorial and example app to quickly learn how to use PowerSync with Supabase.

## Implementation outline

The following outlines our recommended steps to implement PowerSync in your project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="[Optional] Create a PowerSync Cloud account">
    Sign up for a free PowerSync Cloud account [here](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/get-started?powersync=true&s=docs-quickstart) if you want to go with our cloud-hosted option. PowerSync can also be self-hosted - see instructions in the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Source Database">
    Configure your source database for PowerSync - see [Source Database Setup](/installation/database-setup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect PowerSync to your Database">
    Connect your database to your instance of the PowerSync Service:
      1. Using PowerSync Cloud: See [Database Connection](/installation/database-connection) 
      2. Using PowerSync Open Edition (self-hosted): Refer to our [self-hosting section](/self-hosting/getting-started) for configuration details and examples.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Basic Sync Rules">
    Define [Sync Rules](/usage/sync-rules) in PowerSync — this enables dynamic partial replication so that you don't need to sync your entire MongoDB database to devices.
    - We recommend starting with one or two simple [Global Data](/usage/sync-rules/example-global-data) queries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="[Optional] Generate a Development Token">
    Generate a [Development Token](/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens) so you can get up and running quickly, without implementing full custom auth.
  </Step>
  <Step title="[Optional] Test Sync with our Diagnostics App">
    Use our hosted [Diagnostics App](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/tools/diagnostics-app) to validate that your source database is syncing into SQLite as expected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement an app using one of our Client SDKs">
    Implement an app using one of our [Client SDKs](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/introduction)
   1. You can continue using your Development Token for a start
   2. Implement a "Hello World" app to get a feel, **or** jump straight into pulling the Client SDK into your existing app.
   3. Verify that downloads from your source database are working.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Authentication">
   Implement Authentication - see our [docs here](/installation/authentication-setup). 
   1. Some authentication providers already generate JWTs for users which PowerSync can verify directly — see the documentation for individual providers (e.g. [Supabase Auth](/installation/authentication-setup/supabase-auth), [Firebase Auth](/installation/authentication-setup/firebase-auth))
   2. For others, some backend code must be added to your application backend to generate the JWTs needed for PowerSync — see [Custom authentication](/installation/authentication-setup/custom).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your App Backend">
   Implement your [backend app](/installation/app-backend-setup) to accept writes.
    - We have Node.js, Django and Rails demos available [here](/resources/demo-apps-example-projects#custom-backend-examples).
  </Step>
</Steps>
