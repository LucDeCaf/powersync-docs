1. Apply source schema changes (i.e. in Postgres database) (often as a pre-deploy step as part of 2)
2. Deploy backend application changes
3. Deploy [Sync Rule](/usage/sync-rules) changes
4. Wait for Sync Rule reprocessing to complete
5. Publish the app (may be deployed with delayed publishing at any prior point)
