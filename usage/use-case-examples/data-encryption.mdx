### In Transit Encryption

Data is always encrypted in transit using TLS — both between the client and PowerSync, and between PowerSync [and the source database](/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/postgres-maintenance#tls).

### At Rest Encryption

The client-side database can be encrypted at rest using [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/). This can be used in the Flutter SDK with some manual setup. [Contact us](/resources/contact-us) for details, or for support on other platforms.

### End-to-end Encryption

For end-to-end encryption, the encrypted data can be synced using PowerSync. The data can then either be encrypted and decrypted directly in memory by the application, or a separate local-only table can be used to persist the decrypted data — allowing querying the data directly.

An example implementation is coming soon.
