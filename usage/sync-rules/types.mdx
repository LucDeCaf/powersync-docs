description: "PowerSync's Sync Rules use the [SQLite type system](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html)."
---

The supported client-side SQLite types are:

1. `null`
2. `integer`: a 64-bit signed integer
3. `real`: a 64-bit floating point number
4. `text`: An UTF-8 text string
5. `blob`: Binary data

## Postgres Type Mapping

Binary data in Postgres can be accessed in Sync Rules, but cannot be synced directly to clients (it needs to be converted to hex or base64 first — see below), and cannot be used as bucket parameters.

Postgres values are mapped according to this table:

There is no dedicated boolean data type. Boolean values are represented as `1` (true) or `0` (false).

`json` and `jsonb` values are treated as `text` values in their serialized representation. JSON functions and operators operate directly on these `text` values.

## MongoDB (Alpha) Type Mapping

<Info>
  This section is a work in progress. More details for MongoDB are coming soon. In the meantime, check our [MongoDB guide](/resources/migration-guides/mongodb-atlas) to try out our MongoDB alpha support in PowerSync Open Edition, and ask on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/powersync) if you have any questions.
</Info>

* Data is converted to a flat list of columns, one column per top-level field in the MongoDB document.
* Special BSON types are converted to plain SQLite alternatives.
* For example, `ObjectId`, `Date`, `UUID` are all converted to a plain `TEXT` column.
* Nested objects and arrays are converted to JSON arrays, and JSON operators can be used to query them (in the Sync Rules and/or on the client-side).
