## Introduction

We recommend starting with the [PowerSync Overview](/overview/readme-1) to understand the overall architecture of PowerSync and how it works.

### Sign Up for PowerSync Cloud

The easiest way to get started with PowerSync is to use [PowerSync Cloud](https://www.powersync.com/pricing), our hosted offering.

If you have not yet signed up for PowerSync Cloud, [you can do so here](https://accounts.journeyapps.com/portal/get-started?powersync=true&s=docs-quickstart). You can get started with our [Free plan](https://www.powersync.co/pricing).

<Info>
  PowerSync Cloud currently only supports Postgres. To test our alpha MongoDB support, see [Backend Databases Supported](/usage/quickstart-guide#backend-databases-supported) below. Support for MongoDB in PowerSync Cloud is coming soon.

### App Frameworks Supported (Client SDKs)

PowerSync currently works with apps built using:

* [Flutter](/client-sdk-references/flutter)
* [React Native & Expo](/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo)
* [Web (JavaScript)](/client-sdk-references/js-web)
* [Kotlin Multiplatform](/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform) (beta)
* [Swift](/client-sdk-references/swift) (alpha)

### Backend Databases Supported

PowerSync currently works with the following backend databases:

#### Postgres / PostgreSQL

PowerSync works with any [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database that supports logical replication.

* PowerSync has prebuilt functionality (e.g. [auth integration](/usage/installation/authentication-setup/supabase-auth)) to make it easy to use with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), a backend-as-a-service based on Postgres. This is a great way to get started with PowerSync and Postgres. See our [Supabase integration guide here](/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync).
* If you are not using Supabase, please follow the [steps here for source database setup](/usage/installation/database-setup), which includes details on other hosted Postgres providers such as AWS RDS, Azure, Google (GCP), Fly, Neon, etc.

#### MongoDB (alpha)

Alpha support for MongoDB is currently available in our Open Edition (self-hosted). Support for MongoDB in PowerSync Cloud (our hosted offering) is coming soon.

* To test our alpha MongoDB support, see our [MongoDB guide](/resources/migration-guides/mongodb-atlas).

## Self-hosting?

Alternatives to using PowerSync Cloud are to use our self-hosted PowerSync Open Edition or Enterprise Self-Hosted Edition (see [a comparison of editions here](https://www.powersync.com/pricing))

Refer to our [self-hosting section](/self-hosting/getting-started) for configuration details and examples.
