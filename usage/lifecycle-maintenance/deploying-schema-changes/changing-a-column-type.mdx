title: "Changing a Column Type"
description: "If the column types have the same representation in Sync Rules, the type can be changed freely without issues (for example changing between `VARCHAR` and `TEXT`)."

Other type changes, for example changing between `INT` and `TEXT`, require more care.

To change the type, it is usually best to create a new column with the new type, then remove the old column once nothing uses it anymore.

When changing the type of a column without renaming, use a column type mapping to still use the old type for existing client applications.
