## Chat app example

Use this real-world example of a basic chat app to gauge your PowerSync usage and costs, on the [Pro plan](https://www.powersync.com/pricing) of PowerSync Cloud. This is not an exact estimate, but it can help you better understand how your PowerSync usage would be billed on the Pro plan.

<Note>
  This use case has the peculiarity that all data is user-generated and necessarily shared with other users (in the form of messages). More typical use cases might sync the same server-side data with many different users and have less user-generated data to sync.
</Note>

### Overview: Costs by usage (Pro plan)

To illustrate typical costs, consider an example chat app, where users can initiate chats with other users. Users can see their active chats in a list, read messages, and send messages.

For this app, all messages are stored on a backend database like Postgres. PowerSync is used as a sync layer to make sure users see new messages in real-time, and can access or create messages even when their devices are offline.

#### Assumptions

User base assumptions:

* **Daily Active Users (DAUs) are 10% of total app installations.** These are the users that actively open and use your app on a given day, which is typically a small subset of your total app installations. For the calculations below, we estimated DAUs as 10% of the total number of app installations. We use this assumption as an input to calculate the total number of messages sent and received every day.
* **Peak concurrent connections are 10% of DAUs.** This is the maximum number of users actively using your app at exactly the same time as other users, which is typically a small subset of your Daily Active Users. For the calculations below, we estimated peak concurrent connections as 10% of the total number of app installations.

Data size, transfer and storage assumptions:

* **Messages are 0.25 KB in size on average.** 1KB can store around half a page’s worth of text. We assume the average message size on this app will be a quarter of that.
* **DAUs send and receive a combined total of 100 messages per day,** generating 100 rows in the messages table each day**.**
* **Message data is only stored on local databases for three months.** Using PowerSync’s [sync rules](/usage/sync-rules), only messages sent and received in the last 3 months are stored in the local database embedded within a user’s app.
* **No attachments synced through PowerSync.** Attachments like files or photos are not synced through PowerSync.
* **One PowerSync instance.** The backend database connects to a single PowerSync instance. A more typical setup may use 2 PowerSync instances: one for syncing from the staging database and one for the production database. Since staging data volumes are often negligible, we’ve ignored that in this example.

#### Table of Assumptions

| DAUs as % of all installs                  | 10%                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Peak concurrent connections as % of DAUs   | 10%                |
| Messages sent and received per day per DAU | 100                |
| Message average size                       | 0.25 KB            |
| Messages kept on local database for        | 3 months (90 days) |
